# Authentication

DriftGuard uses API keys to authenticate requests. All API requests must include your key in the `X-API-Key` header.

## API Keys

Your API key is provided when you're approved for beta access. Keys look like: dg_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


<Warning>
  - Keep your API key secure — don't commit it to git, don't share it in public forums
  - If compromised, email naveen@driftguard.io immediately to rotate
  - We never ask for your API key via email or support chat
</Warning>

## Using your API key

Include your key in every request:

```bash
curl https://api.driftguard.io/v1/usage \
  -H "X-API-Key: dg_live_xxxxxxxx"
