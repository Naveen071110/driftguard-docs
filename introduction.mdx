# What is DriftGuard?

DriftGuard is a lightweight API that detects when an incoming data schema
has drifted from your defined contract — and tells you exactly what
changed and whether it will break your pipelines.

## The problem it solves

Schema changes are the #1 cause of silent data incidents. A column gets
renamed. A type narrows from `string` to `integer`. A required field disappears.

Your pipeline keeps running. Your dashboard shows wrong numbers.
Nobody notices for three days.

DriftGuard catches this **before it reaches production** — in CI, in your
pipelines, or on a schedule.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define a contract">
    POST your expected schema once — column names, types, nullability rules.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run a check">
    Before any deployment or ingestion, call `POST /v1/checks` with the
    incoming schema.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get a verdict">
    DriftGuard returns `BREAKING`, `WARNING`, or `OK` — with a precise diff
    explaining what changed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What makes it different

- **API-first** — no platform to adopt, no agent to install
- **Metadata-only** — we never touch your raw data
- **Pay-as-you-go** — credits per check, no monthly seat fees
- **CI-ready** — integrates in one curl command
