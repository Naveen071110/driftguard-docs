# DriftGuard API

**Prevent pipeline failures before they happen.** DriftGuard is a metadata-only API that catches breaking schema changes in your data pipelines, warehouses, and integrations.

## What is DriftGuard?

Data pipelines break when schemas change unexpectedly. A column gets renamed. A number becomes a string. A required field disappears. These "small" changes cause big problems: failed DAGs, wrong dashboards, hours of firefighting.

DriftGuard solves this with **data contracts**:

1. **Define** what your data should look like (the contract)
2. **Check** incoming schemas against that contract
3. **Alert** when drift is detected — before it breaks production

## Why DriftGuard?

    We store column names and types, never your actual data. No PII, no security review delays.

    One HTTP endpoint. No platform to adopt, no months-long implementation. Works with dbt, Airflow, Fivetran, or custom Python.

    $10 for 500 checks. No monthly minimums, no contracts. Credits never expire.

## How it works

```bash
# 1. Define your contract
curl -X POST https://api.driftguard.io/v1/contracts \
  -H "X-API-Key: dg_live_xxxxxxxx" \
  -d '{
    "name": "users",
    "schema": {
      "columns": [
        {"name": "id", "type": "integer", "required": true},
        {"name": "email", "type": "string", "required": true}
      ]
    }
  }'

# 2. Check incoming data
curl -X POST https://api.driftguard.io/v1/check \
  -H "X-API-Key: dg_live_xxxxxxxx" \
  -d '{
    "contract_id": "ct_abc123",
    "incoming_schema": {...}
  }'

# 3. Get instant verdict
{
  "result": "breaking",
  "severity": 95,
  "diff": {
    "removed": ["email"],
    "type_changes": [],
    "added": []
  }
}


## What makes it different

- **API-first** — no platform to adopt, no agent to install
- **Metadata-only** — we never touch your raw data
- **Pay-as-you-go** — credits per check, no monthly seat fees
- **CI-ready** — integrates in one curl command
