# Authentication

DriftGuard uses API keys to authenticate requests. All API requests must include your key in the `X-API-Key` header.

## API Keys

Your API key is provided when you're approved for beta access. Keys look like: `dg_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

<Warning>
  - Keep your API key secure — don't commit it to git, don't share it in public forums
  - If compromised, email naveen@driftguard.io immediately to rotate
  - We never ask for your API key via email or support chat
</Warning>

## Using your API key

Include your key in every request:

```bash
curl https://api.driftguard.io/v1/usage \
  -H "X-API-Key: dg_live_xxxxxxxx"
```

## Key types

| Prefix   | Use        | Notes                    |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| dg_live_ | Production | Credits are deducted     |
| dg_test_ | Test       | For sandbox, no credits used |

Always prefer `dg_test_` keys for development and dry-runs.

## Passing the key

With curl:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: dg_live_xxxxxxxx" \
  https://api.driftguard.io/v1/usage
```

## Error codes

| ------ | ------------------------ |
| 401    | Missing or invalid key   |
| 403    | Key valid but no credits |
